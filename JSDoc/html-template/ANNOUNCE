ANNOUNCEMENT: HTML::Template 2.9

HTML::Template - a Perl module to use HTML Templates

CHANGES
   - New Feature: the new force_untaint option makes sure you do not
     pass tainted values to param(). [Sven Neuhaus]

   - New Feature: Added ESCAPE=NONE as a synonym for ESCAPE=0.  Fixed 
     both to work with default_escape. [cpan@punch.net]

   - Bug Fix: DEFAULT didn't work with URL and JS escaping. 

   - Bug Fix: Long-standing bug where variables set in a loop weren't
     available inside inner loops under global_vars if the variable
     wasn't actually used in the outer loop.  (Thanks to Richard Fein
     for help debugging the fix.)

   - Doc Fix: Changed references to CVS in the docs to Subversion now that
     the switch is complete.

   - Test Fix: At long last, the work from the Phalanx project has
     been merged!  The tests are now more complete and easier to work
     on.  Thanks Phalanx guys!


DESCRIPTION

    This module attempts to make using HTML templates simple and natural. It
    extends standard HTML with a few new HTML-esque tags - <TMPL_VAR>,
    <TMPL_LOOP>, <TMPL_INCLUDE>, <TMPL_IF>, <TMPL_ELSE> and <TMPL_UNLESS>.
    The file written with HTML and these new tags is called a template. It
    is usually saved separate from your script - possibly even created by
    someone else! Using this module you fill in the values for the
    variables, loops and branches declared in the template. This allows you
    to separate design - the HTML - from the data, which you generate in the
    Perl script.

    This module is licensed under the GPL. See the LICENSE section below for
    more details.
